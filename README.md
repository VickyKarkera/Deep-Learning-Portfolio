## Introduction

In this portfolio, you will find a variety of machine learning projects covering different domains such as classification, regression, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. Each project comes with detailed documentation and code implementation to help you understand the methodologies and techniques used.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this portfolio:

1. **Sentiment Analysis on Script Data**
   - **Description:** Utilized Python to scrape 50,000 lines of sitcom dialogue script data to gain insights on sentiment of main characters by episode. Implemented Regex techniques to comb through 240 episode scripts and identify key characters and dialogues. Conducted Sentiment Analysis using Python with Googleâ€™s Bert Large Language Model. Aggregated data using pandas and utilized data into Streamlit to build an episode sentiment categorization website.
